# Project-5
This project implements a real-time, demand-driven dynamic pricing system for parking spaces using a combination of Pathway for streaming data processing, Bokeh for live visualization, and machine learning models for prediction and evaluation.

The goal is to adjust parking prices dynamically based on real-time demand signals such as:

Occupancy rate

Queue length

Nearby traffic conditions

Special event days

Vehicle type characteristic
